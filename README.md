The exact folder structure of an EJS application that uses MongoDB and PostgreSQL, and uses Passport for authentication, would depend on the specific design and organization of the application. However, a possible folder structure for such an application might look something like this:


├── authRoutes
│   └── auth.js
├── config
│   ├── passport.js
│   └── postgres.config.js
├── models
│   ├── movies.js
│   └── users.js
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── stylesheets
│       └── style.css
├── routes
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── movies.js
│   └── users.js
└── views
|   ├── error.ejs
|   ├── index.ejs
|   ├── login.ejs
|   ├── movies.ejs
|   └── profile.ejs
├── server.js

In this example, the app.js file is the main entry point for the application, and it contains the code for setting up the server, 
connecting to the databases, and using Passport for authentication. The config folder contains the configuration settings for the databases and Passport, 
such as the postgres.config.js file shown earlier. The models folder contains the MongoDB and PostgreSQL models for the movies and users collections. 
The routes folder contains the route handlers for the different URLs in the application, such as the movies.js and users.js files. The views folder contains the EJS templates
for the different views in the application, such as the movies.ejs file that would display movie data from the databases.
